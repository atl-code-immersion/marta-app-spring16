<h2>Is a Train On Its Way?</h2>

<p>That digital board that's supposed to tell you how soon a train is coming is busted, isn't it?</p>
<p>Or it seems to be stuck on a ad for American Deli?</p>
<p>Pick your station...we'll see if a train will be coming soon.</p>

<div>
	<%= form_tag(trains_path) do %>
		<%= select_tag :station, options_for_select(@stations), {include_blank: "Choose a station"} %>
		<%= submit_tag "Check Trains!" %>
	<% end %>
</div>

<% if @arriving_trains != nil %>
	<h3>These Trains On Nearly There!</h3>
	
	<% @arriving_trains.each do |train| %>
		<ul>
			<li>A <%= train["LINE"] %> Line Train, bound for <%= train["DESTINATION"] %> (<%= train["DIRECTION"] %>)</li>
			<li>Will be arriving in <%= ((Time.now - Time.parse(train["NEXT_ARR"])).abs / 60).round(2) %> mins</li>
		</ul>
	<% end %>
